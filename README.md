This project involves a comprehensive data analysis using the Python programming language and report generation with Power BI. The data is sourced from the USGS Earthquakes API (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/?ref=springboard) and exported into an Excel file, earthquakes_data.xlsx, which is used to populate the Power BI report.

The Power BI report includes the following visualizations:

1)World Map with Earthquake Locations
2)Line Chart for Earthquake Events Over Time
3)Bar Chart of Earthquake Counts by Country and City
4)Heatmap of Earthquake Counts by Alert Level
5)Donut Chart of Earthquakes Causing Tsunamis
6)Table of Detailed Earthquake Data
7)Bar Chart of Earthquake Counts by Magnitude Category
8)Slicers for Year, Month, Type of Event, Alert Type, and Magnitude Type
9)KPI Card with Total Events, Maximum Magnitude, and Most Frequent Alert Type
